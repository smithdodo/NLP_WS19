SpamAssassin Corpus
-------------------

This is a corpus collected by the SpamAssassin team in order to test spam
filtering systems. The version provided in this archive consists of 5336
documents for training and 743 documents for testing. The testing mails are
from the "hard_ham", "easy_ham_2" and "spam_2" subcategories.  The corpus has
been processed and coded in the same format as the "20 newsgroups" corpus, also
available in our web page (including a README containing a short description of
the format).
